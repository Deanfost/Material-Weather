# Material-Weather
A quick and simple look outside.

Material Weather is an Android weather application. It includes all basic weather information, including wind speeds and direction, 
temperatures, sky conditions and more, for your current location. There are hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours, and daily forecasts
for the next week. Everything's here, just for you.

## Your Dashboard
The top half of the screen acts as your dashboard. Get a quick summary by looking at the top of the screen. A scrollable hourly forecast is just within reach below. Look a little further down, and get a glimpse of the week ahead, and don't be afraid to tap on them to get a taste 
of a specific day.

## Your Better Half
Maybe you're one for the details - we are too. Down below, "Current Details" will give you access to data such as the current wind speed and direction, precipitation chance, humidity, and more. Further down, you can check out sunrise and sunset times. 

## Notifications
Don't have the app handy? We've got you covered. Enable ongoing weather notifications and weather alerts to always know what to expect.
