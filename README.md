# Material-Weather
A quick and simple look outside.

Material Weather is an Android weather application. It includes all basic weather information, including wind speeds and direction, 
temperatures, sky conditions and more, for your current location. There are hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours, and daily forecasts
for the next week. In addition, there are a few background services including ongoing weather notifications and weather alerts.

Note - This project is no longer maintained since Android 7.0's release.
